## Project Overview

Build an electromagnetic levitation platform. This would be a from scratch build of a doohicky that's been around for some time, for example here is an amazon link to one of many products utilizing this kind of design, https://www.amazon.com/Levitating-Hexagon-Floating-Suspension-Decoration/dp/B096TJV4DP/ref=sr_1_20?crid=3NS9HOOEL4VK2&keywords=levitation+platform&qid=1695256539&sprefix=levitation+platform%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-20&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc. I'd love to design and build one from scratch, with the main focus being to get a magnet to levitate, but to extend that functionality to making a floating lamp, or to making that floating magnet spin slowly, or other methods of controlling the platform. 

## Educational Value Added

The above design would require a lot of hardware application, and would be an excuse to get hands-on experience beyond labs that only put selected theories into practice. The basic design is that of a forever magnet used as a floating platform above tesla coils and temporary magnets whose strength is controlled by a circuit board. The circuit board must be designed from scratch to take constant feedback from sensors on the board as to the location of the floating magnet, and in response send power to the temporary magnets as needed to balance the floating magnet in place. This would be a really interesting application of a lot of the coursework that I have taken and am currently in. I am in Embedded Circuits, which is a whole course dedicated to getting familiar with one specific circuit board. This project would be a great opportunity to get more comfortable with other kinds of boards, as well as designing my own. The programming of the circuit board would also be a continuation of what I am learning in the homeworks of Embedded Systems, creating code to upload onto the circuit board. The soldering to wire the magnets up to the board would be a big leap from the simple hardware labs of ECE courses, so my soldering skills would have a chance to improve from this change of pace. This project would be a really fun continuation of a lot of concepts from my coursework that interest me, and of course hand on experience designing circuit boards would be extremely valuable.
